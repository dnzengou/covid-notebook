# Python notebooks for Covid-19 data
Notebooks for analysing some Covid-19 data from different sources. Feel free to use the issue tracker for feedback and general discussion.

## Reporting Lag
Using data published by FHM and [processed by @adamaltmejd](https://github.com/adamaltmejd/covid).

You can work with this notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/morberg/covid-notebook/blob/master/covid-lag-sweden.ipynb).

## Total Death Count
Based on data from Statistiska Centralbyr√•n. Interactive version on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/morberg/covid-notebook/blob/master/total-death-count.ipynb)

### Total for Sweden
Death count for 2015-2020. Gray is from 2015-2019. Orange is from 2020. The lines are 20 day rolling averages.

### Total by subset of counties
This graph shows daily death count for four counties. Deaths from 2018-2019 are shown as opaque points, 2020 as a line graph. Choosing other counties should be quite straightforward if you look in the notebook.
