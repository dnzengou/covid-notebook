Average lag by reporting date. Line size is number of deaths reported each day.

Some other graphs are available in the notebook. You can work with it live on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/morberg/covid-notebook/blob/master/covid-lag-sweden.ipynb).

## Total Death Count
Based on data from Statistiska Centralbyr√•n. Interactive version on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/morberg/covid-notebook/blob/master/county-data.ipynb)

You can view an [interactive graph of weekly deaths](https://morberg.github.io/covid-notebook/charts/weekly-deaths.html) in your browser. Click a county in the legend or in the bottom graph to show only that county. Shift-click to multi-select. Click and drag in main graph to select a time period.

### Total for Sweden
Death count for 2018-2020. The lines are 20 day rolling averages.

### Total by subset of counties
This graph shows daily death count for four counties. Deaths from 2018-2019 are shown as opaque points, 2020 as a line graph. If you [run the notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/morberg/covid-notebook/blob/master/county-data.ipynb) you can interactively select the counties you want.
